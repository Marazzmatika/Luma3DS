## Compiling

First you need to clone the repository with: `git clone https://github.com/Marazzmatika/lubbadubba3ds.git`
To compile, you'll need [armips](https://github.com/Kingcom/armips) and a build of a recent commit of [makerom](https://github.com/profi200/Project_CTR) added to your PATH. You'll also need to install [firmtool](https://github.com/TuxSH/firmtool), its README contains installation instructions.
You'll also need to update your [libctru](https://github.com/smealum/ctrulib) install, building from the latest commit.
Here are [Windows](https://buildbot.orphis.net/armips/) and [Linux](https://ev1l0rd.s-ul.eu/mEIk4atQ) builds of armips (thanks to who compiled them!).
Run `make` and everything should work!
You can find the compiled files in the `out` folder.
